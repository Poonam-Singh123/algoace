        <h1>LeetCode 1716: Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank (C++)</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day. He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday. Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: n = 10<br>
                Output: 37<br>
                Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.
