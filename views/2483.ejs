        <h1>LeetCode 2483: Minimum Penalty for a Shop (C++)</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y': if the i<sup>th</sup> character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the i<sup>th</sup> hour whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the i<sup>th</sup> hour. If the shop closes at the j<sup>th</sup> hour (0 &lt;= j &lt;= n), the penalty is calculated as follows: For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1. For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1. Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty. Note that if a shop closes at the j<sup>th</sup> hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: customers = "YYNY"<br/>
                Output: 2<br/>
                Explanation: Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs the minimum penalty. At hour 0, a customer comes, so penalty = 0. At hour 1, no customer comes, so penalty = 1. At hour 2, the shop closes. At hour 3, a customer comes but shop is closed, so penalty = 2. Total penalty = 2.<br/><br/>
                Input: customers = "NNNNN"<br/>
                Output: 0<br/>
                Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 0th hour as no customers arrive.<br/><br/>
                Input: customers = "YYYY"<br/>
                Output: 4<br/>
                Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 4th hour (after all customers have visited).
