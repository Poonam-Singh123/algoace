        <h1>LeetCode 744: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target (C++)</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters. Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"<br/>
                Output: "c"<br/>
                Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.<br/><br/>
                Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"<br/>
                Output: "f"<br/>
                Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'c' in letters is 'f'.<br/><br/>
                Input: letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"<br/>
                Output: "x"<br/>
                Explanation: There are no characters in letters that are lexicographically greater than 'z' so we return letters[0].
