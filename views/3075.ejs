        <h1>LeetCode 3075: Maximize Happiness of Selected Children (C++)</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given an array happiness of length n, and a positive integer k. There are n children standing in a queue, where the i<sup>th</sup> child has happiness value happiness[i]. You want to select k children from these n children in k turns. In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been selected till now decreases by 1. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets decremented only if it is positive. Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting k children.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: happiness = [1,2,3], k = 2<br/>
                Output: 4<br/>
                Explanation: We can pick 2 children in the following way: Pick the child with happiness value 3. The happiness value of all other children decreases by 1. Now, happiness = [0,1,3]. Pick the child with happiness value 1. The happiness value of the remaining child decreases by 1. Now, happiness = [0,1,3]. The sum of the happiness values of the selected children is 3 + 1 = 4.<br/><br/>
                Input: happiness = [1,1,1,1], k = 2<br/>
                Output: 1<br/>
                Explanation: We can pick 2 children in any way. The happiness values will become [0,0,0,1] after first pick and [0,0,0,0] after second pick. Maximum sum is 1 + 0 = 1.<br/><br/>
                Input: happiness = [2,3,4,5], k = 1<br/>
                Output: 5<br/>
                Explanation: We can pick the child with happiness value 5. Maximum sum is 5.
