        <h1>LeetCode 3100: Water Bottles II (C++)</h1>

        <div class="problem-description">
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong>
                You are given two integers numBottles and numExchange. numBottles represents the number of full water bottles. In one operation, you can drink any number of full water bottles and turn them into empty bottles. Then exchange numExchange empty bottles for one full water bottle. However, after each exchange, numExchange increases by 1. Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
                Input: numBottles = 13, numExchange = 6<br>
                Output: 15<br>
                Explanation: Drink 13 bottles. Exchange 6 empty bottles for 1 full (now need 7 for next). Drink 1, have 8 empty. Exchange 7 for 1 full (now need 8). Drink 1, have 2 empty. Cannot exchange anymore. Total: 13 + 1 + 1 = 15.
            </p>

        // Empty bottles we have after drinking initial bottles
        int emptyBottles = numBottles;
        
        // Keep exchanging while we have enough empty bottles
        while (emptyBottles &gt;= numExchange) {
            // Exchange numExchange empty bottles for 1 full bottle
            emptyBottles -= numExchange;
            
            // Drink the newly obtained full bottle
            totalDrunk++;
            
            // The bottle we just drank becomes empty
            emptyBottles++;

            numExchange++;
